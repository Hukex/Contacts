If you want only to play just go to preview and click on "You can try it!" download the .jar file and if you have java installed it will run with double click.

In case you want to edit it, well in my case I used NetBeans 8.2 so install it and you will be able to open it without any problem. Remember to clone the project to avoid issues with the project.
